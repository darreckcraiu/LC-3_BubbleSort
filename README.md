# Bubble Sort in Assembly

This is a fork of a collaborative class project originally hosted at [https://github.com/marina-ig/LC-3_BubbleSort]. My contribution to the project was the majority of the conception and implementation of the program logic.
This repository contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm written in Assembly language.

## Description

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Implementation

The Bubble Sort algorithm is implemented in the `Bubble_Sort.asm` file. 

### Features

- Implements the classic Bubble Sort algorithm
- Written in Assembly for educational purposes
- Demonstrates basic concepts of sorting algorithms and Assembly language programming

## Usage

To assemble and run the `Bubble_Sort.asm` file, you can use an assembler + simulator like LC-3.
